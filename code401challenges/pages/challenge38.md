## Challenge
<p>Extend your graph object with a depth-first traversal method. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.</p>


## Approach & Efficiency
I basically wrote a depth first tree traversal but instead added everything to a hashset as it went through so values would not repeat.
